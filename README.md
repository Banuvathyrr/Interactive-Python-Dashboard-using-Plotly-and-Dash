<h1 align="center"> Interactive Student Performance Dashboard using Dash, DBC and Plotly</h1>

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
I recently developed a Python-based web dashboard that visualizes student performance data and suggests tailored learning paths based on real-time data retrieved from a MySQL database. The dashboard provides users with the ability to personalize insights by selecting specific candidates, topics, and difficulty levels through dynamic dropdown menus. With key performance indicators like percentage incorrect, relevant study materials, and high-priority topics for improvement, users can explore targeted metrics through a responsive sidebar for seamless navigation across sections like overall performance and topic-specific analyses.

## ðŸ”§ KEY FEATURES
- **DATABASE INTEGRATION**: Data is retrieved in real time from a MySQL database, allowing efficient data storage, management, and scalability.
- **DYNAMIC INTERACTIVITY**: Dash callbacks update the dashboardâ€™s visuals and data based on user selections, ensuring relevant insights are always at hand.
- **PROFESSIONAL UI DESIGN**: Customized styling through Dash Bootstrap Components (DBC) creates a polished, responsive layout thatâ€™s both user-friendly and professional.
- **REAL-TIME PERFORMANCE METRICS**: Card visuals display essential metrics like accuracy rates and topic relevance, providing actionable insights and enhancing the user experience.

## ðŸ“š TECH STACK
- **PYTHON DASH**: For web app development and interactivity.
- **MYSQL**: As the data source, providing reliable storage and retrieval for real-time insights.
- **PLOTLY**: For high-quality data visualizations.
- **DASH BOOTSTRAP COMPONENTS (DBC)**: For responsive, intuitive UI design.
- **PANDAS**: For efficient data manipulation and analysis.

## ðŸŽ¯ PROJECT IMPACT
This dashboard demonstrates the powerful combination of data science and web development, offering educators and organizations a dynamic tool to monitor and analyze student performance. It provides a solid foundation for making data-driven decisions that enhance learning outcomes, leveraging real-time MySQL data integration to keep insights current and relevant.
